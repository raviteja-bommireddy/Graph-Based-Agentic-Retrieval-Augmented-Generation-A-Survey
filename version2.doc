Summary of Main Changes::::::::::::::

-- need to figure out --

Current work / To do:::::::::::::::
1. Rewriting other sections to fit new structure and incorporating additional research.
2. Lacking at explaning the overall spectrum of agentic RAG.
3. SHould make clear contribution with proper novelty in the survey paper

Deep Analysis of Your Paper

Strengths (Pros)

Comprehensive Scope: Covers agentic multi-hop reasoning, graph-based workflows, and orchestration patterns. Offers taxonomy and deep synthesis of recent empirical and methodological progress.

Benchmarking: Systematically maps datasets, evaluation protocols, and representative systems. Cites documented multi-hop accuracy improvements over flat RAG approaches.

Design Patterns: Identifies model-mediated traversal, evaluator-optimizer loops, and hybrid retrieval strategies.

Research Agenda: Proposes focused future work addressing scalability, time/temporal graphs, privacy, explainability, differentiable symbolic modules, and federated graph reasoning.

Clear Writing: Abstract and introduction are technically strong and clarify the motivation.

Relevance: Highly aligned with the state-of-the-art trends in NLP and RAG systems for high-impact knowledge reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses (Cons)

Novelty/Contribution: Mostly a survey and consolidation of recent work; may not introduce breakthrough methods or experiments if considered for oral tracks.

Experimental Detail: Depth of empirical benchmarking or system comparison is unclear from the abstract—top conferences often require rigorous quantitative evaluation.

Scalability Claims: Scalability to web-scale graphs is identified as future work, but demonstrated solutions may lack.

Multimodal Handling: Only briefly mentions multimodal and temporal reasoning; full experiments on these fronts would strengthen impact.

Privacy and Explainability: Points out open problems but may lack concrete frameworks, implementation, or exhaustive privacy analyses.

References: Needs strong connection to the very latest submissions to stand out at venues where cutting-edge work is prioritized.
