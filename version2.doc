Summary of Main Changes: 

-- need to figure out �


Current work / To do: 
1. Rewriting other sections to fit new structure and incorporating additional research.
2. Lacking at explaining the overall spectrum of agentic RAG.
3. Should make clear contribution with proper novelty in the survey paper


Outline:

1. Introduction (4 subsections)

* Motivation contextualizing the convergence of RAG, graphs, and agents

* Problem statement highlighting limitations of traditional RAG

* Why Graph-Agentic RAG matters (5 key advantages)

* Survey contributions and scope

2. Background (Comprehensive foundational framework)

* RAG Evolution (Traditional ? Advanced ? Graph ? Agentic)

* Knowledge Graphs fundamentals

* Agentic intelligence patterns

* Design patterns (Reflection, Planning, Tool Use, Collaboration)

3. Taxonomy of Architectures (4 major categories)

* Single-Agent: Agent-G system with hybrid retrieval

* Multi-Agent: GeAR system with specialized agents

* Hierarchical: Coordinator + worker agents

* Corrective/Adaptive: Error detection and dynamic strategy selection

4. Design Patterns & Implementation 

* Graph construction and maintenance

* Query understanding and decomposition

* Graph traversal strategies (BFS, Beam Search, RL-based)

* LLM-based reasoning with prompting strategies

* Hybrid retrieval integration

5. Representative Systems

* Agent-G: 72% accuracy on HotpotQA (+33% vs. baseline)

* GeAR: 76% accuracy on ComplexWebQuestions (+41% improvement)

* GraphAgent: 88.2% F1 on node classification

6. Benchmarking & Evaluation (3 subsections)

* Multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, ComplexWebQuestions)

* Metrics: EM, F1, ROUGE, hallucination rate, latency

* Empirical results table with comparative analysis

7. Applications (4 domains)

* Healthcare (clinical decision support)

* Finance (fraud detection, risk assessment)

* Legal (contract review, obligation extraction)

* Scientific discovery

8. Evaluation Frameworks

* Explainability assessment through path transparency

* Human evaluation protocols

* Fairness and bias assessment

9. Future Directions 

* Temporal and dynamic reasoning

* Privacy-preserving graph reasoning

* Differentiable/neuro-symbolic integration

* Multi-modal graphs

* Explainability improvements

* Knowledge verification


Paper Strengths (Pros)

* Comprehensive Scope: Covers agentic multi-hop reasoning, graph-based workflows, and orchestration patterns. Offers taxonomy and deep synthesis of recent empirical and methodological progress.

* Benchmarking: Systematically maps datasets, evaluation protocols, and representative systems. Cites documented multi-hop accuracy improvements over flat RAG approaches.

* Design Patterns: Identifies model-mediated traversal, evaluator-optimizer loops, and hybrid retrieval strategies.

* Research Agenda: Proposes focused future work addressing scalability, time/temporal graphs, privacy, explainability, differentiable symbolic modules, and federated graph reasoning.

* Clear Writing: Abstract and introduction are technically strong and clarify the motivation.

* Relevance: Highly aligned with the state-of-the-art trends in NLP and RAG systems for high-impact knowledge reasoning tasks.

Paper Weaknesses (Cons)

* Novelty/Contribution: Mostly a survey and consolidation of recent work; may not introduce breakthrough methods or experiments if considered for oral tracks.

* Experimental Detail: Depth of empirical benchmarking or system comparison is unclear from the abstract. 

* Scalability Claims: Scalability to web-scale graphs is identified as future work, but demonstrated solutions may lack.

* Multimodal Handling: Only briefly mentions multimodal and temporal reasoning; full experiments on these fronts would strengthen impact.

* Privacy and Explainability: Points out open problems but may lack concrete frameworks, implementation, or exhaustive privacy analyses.

* References: Needs strong connection to the very latest submissions to stand out at venues where cutting-edge work is prioritized.
